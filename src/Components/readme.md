*Response of Chat GPT when i showed him my version of react-router-dom*

Thank you for providing the version of react-router-dom. It appears that you are using version 6 of react-router-dom, which has some changes compared to previous versions. In React Router version 6, the Switch component has been replaced with Routes.

Here's how you can modify your import and usage to work with React Router version 6:

Update Import Statement:

Update your import statement for Routes and remove the import for Switch.

javascript
Copy code
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Route,
  Routes // Replace Switch with Routes
} from "react-router-dom";
Replace Switch with Routes:

In your routing configuration, replace the <Switch> component with <Routes>. The syntax for defining routes has also changed in version 6. Here's an example:

jsx
Copy code
<Router>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
    {/* Add more routes here */}
  </Routes>
</Router>
You'll need to update your route definitions accordingly.

With these changes, your React Router configuration should work correctly with version 6. Make sure to update your routes to use the new syntax introduced in React Router version 6.



*NOTE* we've commented out all router related code becuz it was just for understanding the concept of router and also when we put our project on github and try to deploy it , routing doesnt  work properly with github so we have comment it out
